-need visualization of creating the gbst from sbst, node by node construction
-previously inserted elements just touch that node instead of inserting
-show via (green?) dots the touched nodes in the gbst upon insert in sbst
  -show each node one at a time appearing as i step through the sbst
-needs labels for each side sbst and gbst
-labels for the gbst graph
-allows user to input satisfier (red) dots and show what tree that corresponds to
-include a couple demo sequences (helps for demos)
-manually step through the conversion from gbst to sbst
-show which nodes correspond to which by clicking and highlighting
-clean up axes to remove excess points
