-i expect to see dots showing which nodes were touched on insertion reflected in the geometric view
-note that the tree rebalancing is based on AVL
-make geometric should insert points with the same insertion order the user used
-I don’t understand what “Make Standard BST” button does. What is a “standard BST”?
-Nodes flying in from the left is maybe not the best aesthetic choice for animation, come in from bottom instead
-The scaling on the left is cut off. Autozoom instead of making user do it?

vEB delete? predecessor/successor?
Is there some way to visualize not-recursively-stored mins?  It seems that what you’re visualizing is actually an x-fast tree. So you should probably call it that, unless you figure out how to visualize actual vEB.
-Maybe show the highlighting of two links at once? (At the current speed, people might think that those two links had just gone one by one, and since the tree is so small, that’s the only step that’s more than one level.
